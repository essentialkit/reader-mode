# Github Pages

The contents of this directory are automatically pushed to the `gh-pages` branch using the [.github/workflows/gh-deploy.yml](../.github/workflows/gh-deploy.yml).


It powers the Github pages site at https://justiceo.github.io/reader-mode/.

The theme is specified in the [_config.yml](_config.yml) file. For alternatives see https://pages.github.com/themes/.

For more information on configuring Github pages deployment see https://github.com/marketplace/actions/push-git-subdirectory-as-branch.

If a domain is pointed to the Github Page, Github would automatically add a CNAME file to this branch.
Check in that CNAME locally to avoid overwrite.
